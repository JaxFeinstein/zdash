            We are a team of developers funded with ZEC by the community to build applications that support the Zcash ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each app is assigned a shielded (z) address. A view key is provided so anyone can see what the app earns.
          </p>
          <p>
            A portion of each app's earnings is routed back to a general developer fund, which is used to support ongoing development across the ecosystem.

          <p>
            Transparency is central to our mission. We demonstrate this by building apps that generate revenue transparently and return a share to fund more development.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start with nearly zero ZEC every time. Each grant uses a transparent (t) address for collecting funds.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also maintain a central t address for the general developer fund. These addresses make all inflows and outflows fully visible and traceable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Funds are used exclusively to pay developers. If any funding is needed beyond that purpose, we issue a separate grant.
          </p>
          <p>
            All developer payouts are shielded by default. Incoming transparent funds are automatically shielded (t to z) to maintain user and developer anonymity.
          </p>
          <p>
            All earnings percentages and developer payouts are logged on-chain and can be viewed via project view keys.
          </p>
